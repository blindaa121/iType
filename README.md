# Summary & Functionality
iType is a speed typing game that allows players to practice their typing skills and accuracy. The main screen will display the level of difficulty that the user may choose from (Easy, Medium, Hard). Once the player selects a level, the screen will then render the first word and will begin once the player starts typing.

Depending on the level, the player will then have a certain amount of time to type as many words as possible, where the final score is determined by the correctly spelled words.

# Technologies
iType will be powered by Javascript, HTML5, and CSS.

# Implementation Timeline 

### Day 1: Map out skelenton of the code, research any documentation on how to implement sound, pick out color scheme/theme. What do I want this game to look like?

### Day 2: Begin the gameplay functionality and logic, as well as any light styling to get a better visual of the gamee.

### Day 3: Research different API's to fetch words or quotes and implement them into the code. Finalize visuals, stylings, and sounds.
